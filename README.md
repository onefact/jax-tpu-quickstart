# TPU Quickstart Guide: 

## Part 1 - Setting Up

This guide will help you get started with using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) on Google Cloud Platform.

## Introduction

Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are custom-designed hardware accelerators for running machine learning workloads. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using TPUs in the Google Cloud Console.

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud account
- Billing enabled for your project
- TPU API enabled in your project

## Step 1: Accessing the TPU Dashboard

1. Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to the TPU section

You should see a screen similar to the one below:

## TPU Configuration

In this example, we're using the following configuration:

- Zone: us-central1-b
- TPU type: v3-8
- TPU software version: tpu-ubuntu2204-base
- Architecture: TPU VM

## Next Steps

In the next part of this guide, we'll cover how to create a TPU VM and connect to it.
